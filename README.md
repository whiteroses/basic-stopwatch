# Basic stopwatch

`<Enter>` to start/pause/resume.

`reset` to reset stopwatch and start from 0.

`<Ctrl-d>`(EOF) or `exit` to exit.

Any other string input at the prompt has no effect and does not affect the
stopwatch; we can use this to add short notes on what we're recording.


== To-dos ==

* Save data to file.
* Animated display of elapsed time instead of only showing the time when the
  stopwatch is stopped.
* Alarms that sound after a preset length of time.
* Multiple stopwatches running in parallel.
